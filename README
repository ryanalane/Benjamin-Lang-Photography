Benjamin Lang Photography is a simple rails app for managing a photography portfolio. It is currently being developed for a photographer friend of mine (Ben Lang), but the eventual goal is to generalize it as a light-weight portfolio CMS.

This project also serves as a sandbox for getting familiar with Rails development, associated technologies (CoffeeScript, SASS, etc.), and building a project to production.
